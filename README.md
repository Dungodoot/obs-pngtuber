2. Under `Docks > Custom Browser Docks...`, add the URL below as a custom dock and click `Apply`.
```

3. Create a browser source with the URL:
```
https://dungodoot.github.io/obs-pngtuber/source
```
4. Under `Tools > obs-websocket` settings, click on `Show Connect Info` and take note of the server port and server password. **:warning: DO NOT SHOW THIS ON STREAM. :warning:**
5. Enter the server port and password in the custom dock.
